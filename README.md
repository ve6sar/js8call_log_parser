# js8call_log_parser

This script is part of the auroralpower ca 60m radio propagation study. 

This script was written to parse the js8call DIRECTED.TXT script looking for specific callsigns. When a line in the log is found that has a matching callsign, that line is parsed and inserted into a database for later dataporcessing.
